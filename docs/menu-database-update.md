# Menu Database Update Guide

## Issue Fixed

The website had duplicate menus - hardcoded menus (Home and Projects) and database-driven menus appearing together in both header and footer. Now all menus are exclusively from the database.

## Required Menu Items

To ensure proper navigation, please add these essential menu items in the dashboard:

1. **Home**

   - Title: "Home"
   - URL: "/"
   - Order: 1
   - Active: ✓ checked
   - Parent Menu: (leave empty)

2. **Projects**
   - Title: "Projects"
   - URL: "/#projects"
   - Order: 10 (or last position)
   - Active: ✓ checked
   - Parent Menu: (leave empty)
   - Add child menu items for each project if needed

## How to Add These Menu Items

1. Go to `/dashboard/website-menu`
2. Click "Add New Menu"
3. Fill in the details as shown above
4. Click "Save"

You can also add additional menu items like:

- About
- News
- Contact
- Etc.

## Benefits

- No more duplicate menus in the header, footer, and mobile menu
- All navigation is managed through the database
- Consistent menus across desktop and mobile
- Easy to add, edit, or remove menu items without code changes

## Important Note

The hardcoded menus have been completely removed from both header and footer. If you don't add these items to the database, they won't appear in the navigation at all.
